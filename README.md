# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Advanced CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model uses advanced techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout to improve performance.

## Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Random cropping and horizontal flipping for better generalization.
- **CNN Architecture**: Three convolutional layers with increasing filters, Batch Normalization, and Dropout.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Tracks training and test losses and test accuracy over epochs.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for future use.
